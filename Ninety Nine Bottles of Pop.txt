Ninety Nine Bottles of Pop

99 bottles of pop on the wall
99 bottles of pop
If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
98 bottles of pop on the wall.

98 bottles of pop on the wall
98 bottles of pop
If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
97 bottles of pop on the wall.

Now I will count how many bottles on the floor
99 bottles subtract 97
Equals to 2
So there's 2 bottles on the floor.
